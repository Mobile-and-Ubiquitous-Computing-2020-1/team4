## Building the app

In order to build the project you have to store your Foursquare Places API keys in cicerone/secrets.properties like so

```
FOURSQUARE_ID = "[your Foursquare API ID]"  
FOURSQUARE_SECRET = "[your Foursquare API secret]"
```

The functionality of the app relies on data retrieved from the Foursquare Places API meaning that it is also affected by any limits your API key might have. Please check with Foursquare for API rate limits and acquire the account type and keys before building the app.

Once you have the API keys in place you can simply build it using Android Studio.
